# Secure-password-generator

Welcome to my Secure Password Generator web application! Thank you very much for trusting us with your cyber security.

The app contains strings with each of the allowed character types for your password. When a user is prompted to choose the types of characters, the strings are added to an new string, from which the password is randomly generated. A user's password may be anywhere from 12 characters to 128.

If you have any questions, concerns, or general feedback please contact me at Siegelal@protonmail.com or through my website at https://siegelal7.github.io/Andrews-Responsive-Portfolio/contact.html.
